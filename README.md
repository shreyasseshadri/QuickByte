# KoolKey
A Kool Key Value store

## Initial Plan

- [ ] Make an executable that given a key value pair must append it to a file
- [ ] Write an indexer that has contains the byte offset in the file
- [ ] Provide querying API that first indexes the key and then writes, and then retrieves.
- [ ] Provide persistant storage to the indexer


> NOTE: CLI support can be provided once project has reached some major milestone. For now we test using test case files directly calling the APIs
